## Description

Browser-based Bingo game coded in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### MVP

- As a user, I want a browser-based interface so that I can play the game.
- As a user, I want to place a tic so that I can interact with the game.
- As a user, I want the game to reach a win state so that I know who won and can play again.


### Stretch Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to see which values have been called so I know if one of my squares were called or not.
- As a user, I want the game to indicate whether I won or lost so I can either keep playing or start a new game.
- As a user, I want the ability to restart the game.
- As a user, I want to see a screen that tells me how to play the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many times I won so I can brag to my friends.
- As a user, I want to be able to customize the game so it looks the way I want it to.
- As a user, I want to play against multiple bots.
